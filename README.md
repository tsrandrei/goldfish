# Happy-Hacking

Are you a goldfish?
Your memory leak as a Rails app on Heroku ?
You forget all the commands to be issued in your terminal all the time ?
You reinstall often your Linux OS ?

Then this script is made for you.

It launches a series of cli commands, for the basic setup :
 - Ruby
 - Rbenv
 - Elixir
 - Node
 - Postgres
 - Zsh

So yeah, grab a coffee, and let the machine do the work-machine.

It might not be perfect...I'm a goldfish.
So it might come with updates.
